  <p>
    <span class="content-semibold">mCPod</span> is an on-line database of
    photometric observations of magnetic chemically peculiar stars (hereafter
    mCP stars), the result of close cooperation of the following european
    institutes:

      Astrophysics Division, Department of Theoretical Physics and Astropysics,

    The goal of this extensive project is to collect all published data of
    photometric observations of mCP stars in optical and near infrared band.

  <h2 class="content-h2">Why mCPod?</h2>
  <hr class="content-hr" />
  <p>
    The acronym mCPod (mCP observation database) was coined by Zdeněk Mikulášek
    in 2007 in order to simplify referring to our database in electronic and
    personal communication. The noticeable similarity to the name of the most
    popular MP3 player is not arbitrary. It is suggesting the fact that the
    database was created in order to make routine tasks enjoyable. It is
    supposed to be one of the tiny little things that give meaning to the
    astrophysicist's life.

  <h2 class="content-h2">How much data can one find in the database?</h2>
  <hr class="content-hr" />
  <p>
    Nowadays mCPod contains
    <span class="content-semibold">
      {{numberOfMeasurements}} photometric measurements of {{numberOfStars}} mCP
      stars
    </span>
    . This number is growing up constantly as we are feeding the database with
    recent photometric data.
