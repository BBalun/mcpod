## Nice to have:
- [ ] disable option to hide datasets (by clicking on dataset name on the right side of the chart)
- [ ] deploy somewhere

  - [ ] fetch data from the BE as it is stored
- [ ] rewrite scripts in `/data/data` to use Node instead of Deno 
  (may not be necessary, because this should be run only once during development)
