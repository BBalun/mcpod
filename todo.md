## Nice to have:
- [ ] disable option to hide datasets (by clicking on dataset name on the right side of the chart)

  - [ ] fetch data from the BE as it is stored
- [x] rewrite scripts in `/data/data` to use Node instead of Deno 
  (may not be necessary, because this should be run only once during development)
- [ ] seed script - insert csv files into db manually - using prisma.createMany (just to simplify path mapping to data dir from BE (seed script) and DB (CSV insertion))
